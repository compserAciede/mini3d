In this article, we will review the latest version of MDaemon Pro, v13.0.4, which was released on January 15th, 2013. We will highlight some of the new features and improvements that this version offers, as well as some of the issues that have been fixed.
 
## New Features and Improvements
 
One of the most notable changes in MDaemon Pro v13.0.4 is the replacement of Cyren Anti-Virus with IKARUS Anti-Virus. Cyren recently announced its plans to discontinue operations with little warning, which forced Alt-N Technologies, the developer of MDaemon Pro, to find a new anti-virus partner. After a thorough evaluation, IKARUS stood out for its excellent detection rate and speed. The IKARUS Anti-Virus automatically updates its definitions every 10 minutes and scans both incoming and outgoing messages for viruses and malware[^1^].
 
Another change in MDaemon Pro v13.0.4 is the removal of Cyren Outbreak Protection, which was an anti-spam feature that used real-time data from Cyren's global network to block emerging threats. Alt-N Technologies is actively researching and considering viable antispam technologies as suitable additions to the existing antispam mechanisms found in MDaemon Pro[^1^]. In the meantime, MDaemon Pro still offers other anti-spam tools, such as Bayesian learning, reverse lookups, blacklists, whitelists, content filtering, and more.
 
A third change in MDaemon Pro v13.0.4 is the addition of Vietnamese language support to WorldClient, which is the webmail client that comes with MDaemon Pro. WorldClient allows users to access their email from any web browser and offers features such as calendars, contacts, tasks, notes, folders, spell check, and more. WorldClient now supports 29 languages[^1^], making it more accessible and user-friendly for international customers.
 
Other new features and improvements in MDaemon Pro v13.0.4 include[^1^]:
 
- The IMAP server now allows messages to be copied into a user's Deleted Items folder even when over quota, so users of IMAP clients that copy messages into Deleted Items when deleting them are able to delete messages successfully.
- The IMAP keyword flags support can now be enabled or disabled via a setting in MDaemon.ini file. IMAP keyword flags are used to assign custom labels or tags to messages.
- The ClamAV engine has been updated to version 0.105.2.
- The LetsEncrypt script has been updated to check orders that are ready or valid.
- The ActiveSync server has been fixed to resolve some issues with iOS devices, Microsoft Mail, and shared folders.
- The WorldClient themes have been fixed to resolve some issues with deleting, copying, moving contacts, and searching messages for non-ASCII characters.
- The Pro theme has been fixed to resolve some issues with changing special folders, saving contacts to distribution lists, and enabling voice recorder.

## Issues Fixed
 
MDaemon Pro v13.0.4 also fixes some vulnerabilities that were found in previous versions of the software. According to Tenable Network Security[^2^], MDaemon Pro versions earlier than 13.0.4 were potentially affected by the following vulnerabilities:

- An error related to the 'Strip X-Headers' setting that could allow the application to crash.
- A buffer overflow error related to parsing specially crafted email messages that could allow arbitrary code execution.
- A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability related to processing HTML email messages that could allow an attacker 0f148eb4a0
