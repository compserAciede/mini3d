## What is Trapcode Particular?
 
Trapcode Particular is a plugin for After Effects that allows you to add particles to your compositions to bring your motion graphics work to life. You can use 3D objects for even more beauty and complexity. Trapcode Particular is now a part of Maxon One App[^1^], which gives you access to other powerful tools like Cinema 4D and Redshift.
 
Trapcode Particular has many features and benefits that make it a must-have plugin for any After Effects user. Some of them are:
 
- **Designer**: Trapcode Particular gives you the ability to build particle effects visually, with a powerful designer that makes generating effects more creative and intuitive than ever before. You can add adjustable blocks with preset behaviors and styles for emitters, particles, physics, and aux particles. Or you can add complete, customizable particle effects with a single click[^1^].
- **Fluid Dynamics**: Trapcode Particular lets you create dynamic, swirling effects with the new Dynamic Fluids physics engine, which allows particles to behave as if they are moving through real fluids. You can choose from 4 customizable fluidic behaviors[^1^].
- **GPU-Accelerated**: Trapcode Particular offers fast feedback with its new GPU acceleration through OpenGL. Depending on your system and setup, you could see speed boosts of up to 4X or more over previous versions[^1^].
- **3D Camera and Lights**: Trapcode Particular uses After Effects' 3D camera and lights so you can fully integrate your particle effects with your motion graphics and live-action VFX shots[^1^].
- **Multiple Systems**: Trapcode Particular allows you to explore endless creative possibilities when you combine multiple particle systems in the same 3D space. You can create beautiful, complex effects through the interaction of different systems, all within one instance of Particular. Emitters in multi-system setups can share parameter settings (such as turbulence, gravity, and more), and can be saved as a single preset[^1^].
- **Text Emitter**: Trapcode Particular enables you to use text as an emitter, speeding up the creation process dramatically from previous versions. No precomputing required. You can create write-on effects by controlling the reveal of particles along text paths[^1^].
- **Mask Emitters**: Trapcode Particular also lets you use masks as an emitter, making it simple to create uniquely shaped emitters or to use parts of an image as the source of particle emissions[^1^].
- **Preset Library**: Trapcode Particular comes with over 355 presets, designed to give you a head start. Every preset is fully-customizable[^1^]. You can also download more presets from online sources like GFXPlugin.com[^2^], where you can find cracked versions of Trapcode Particular for free.
