## Tips for Playing Dark Souls Prepare To Die Edition
 
Dark Souls Prepare To Die Edition is not a game for the faint of heart. It is a game that will challenge you at every turn, and make you learn from your mistakes. However, it is also a game that will reward you with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when you overcome its many obstacles and enemies. Here are some tips that might help you in your journey through the world of Lordran.
 
- Choose your starting class and gift wisely. Your starting class will determine your initial stats and equipment, but it will not limit your options later on. You can level up any stat and use any weapon or armor, as long as you meet the requirements. However, some classes might have an easier time in the early game than others. For example, the Warrior has good strength and dexterity, which allows him to use a variety of weapons. The Knight has high vitality and heavy armor, which makes him more durable. The Wanderer has high dexterity and mobility, which makes him faster and more agile. The Pyromancer has a powerful ranged attack with his fire spells, which can be useful against tough enemies. The Sorcerer has low physical stats but high intelligence, which makes him a master of magic. The Cleric has high faith and can use miracles, which are healing and buffing spells. The Thief has high luck and can use a master key, which can open some locked doors. The Bandit has high strength and endurance, which makes him good at wielding heavy weapons and shields. The Hunter has high dexterity and can use a bow, which can be useful for sniping enemies from afar. The Deprived has low stats but high potential, as he can customize his build from scratch.
- Your starting gift is a one-time item that can give you an edge in the game. Some of them are more useful than others. For example, the Master Key can open some locked doors that would otherwise require specific keys, which can allow you to access some areas earlier than intended. The Pendant has no apparent use, but it might have a hidden meaning. The Tiny Being's Ring gives you a slight boost to your HP, which can be helpful in the early game. The Old Witch's Ring allows you to talk to a certain NPC, which can reveal some lore and secrets. The Binoculars allow you to zoom in on distant objects, which can be useful for scouting or sniping. The Black Firebombs are powerful explosives that can deal heavy damage to enemies, especially bosses. The Twin Humanities are consumable items that can restore your humanity and heal you fully, which can be useful in a pinch. The Divine Blessing is a rare item that can heal you fully and cure any status effects, which can be a lifesaver in some situations.
- Learn how to use your humanity. Humanity is a resource that has multiple uses in the game. You can find it as an item or by killing certain enemies or players online. You can consume it to restore your health fully or to increase your humanity counter by one. Your humanity counter affects your item discovery rate, your curse resistance and your damage with certain weapons. You can also use it at a bonfire to reverse your hollowing or to kindle the bonfire. Reversing your hollowing restores your human appearance and allows you to summon other players or NPCs for co-op or be invaded by other players or NPCs for PvP. Kindling the bonfire increases the number of Estus Flasks you get from that bonfire by five, up to a maximum of 20.
- Make use of the bonfires. Bonfires are checkpoints that allow you to rest, heal, level up, repair your equipment, attune your spells and access your storage box. They also respawn most enemies in the area, so be careful when resting at them. You can also warp between certain bonfires later in the game, which makes traveling easier.
- Level up your stats according to your playstyle and equipment preferences. There are nine stats in the game: Vitality (VIT), Attunement (ATT), Endurance (END), Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Resistance (RES), Intelligence (INT), Faith (FTH) and Humanity (HUM). Each stat has a different effect on your character's performance and abilities.
    - Vitality increases your maximum HP, which determines how much damage you can take before dying.
    - Attunement increases your number of attun 0f148eb4a0
